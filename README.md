# Lemma Synthesis

## Requirements

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [CVC4 1.9](https://cvc4.github.io/downloads.html)

## Execution

- Clone or download the repo
- Enter top-level directory: `cd lemma-synthesis`
- Dowload the latest nightly build binary of cvc4 from `https://cvc4.github.io/downloads.html` and add it to `PATH`: execute `export PATH ="/path/to/cvc4binary":$PATH` or add it to `~/.bashrc` and then do `source ~/.bashrc`. Alternatively, you can build from source.
  - The specific commit used to compile all examples in the Makefile is 2faf908e
- Make sure that `cvc4 --version` succeeds. You may want to rename the binary or alias it to `cvc4`.
- Add the path to the src/ folder to `PYTHONPATH`: execute `export PYTHONPATH ="/path/to/src":$PYTHONPATH` or add it to `~/.bashrc` and then do `source ~/.bashrc`.
- To run all examples: `make -s -i`
  - NOTE: Ignoring the `-i` flag will cause `make` to abort if any of the examples fail.
- To cleanup all files generated by running examples: `make clean`
- To run indidvidual examples: `python3 <filename>.py`
- To run CVC4 files directly using SyGuS: `cvc4 --lang=sygus2 <filename>.sy`
  - add option `--sygus-stream` to print outputs indefinitely
  - add option `--sygus-abort-size=<n>` with previous option to print outputs up to size `n`
- NOTE: The project uses temporary files to store and read data during execution. Therefore, it is not advisable to run multiple instances of the same example as they will each write to the same temporary files.
